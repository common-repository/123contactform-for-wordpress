== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't my plugin appear in the WordPress menu after unzipping the *123contact-wp-plugin* folder? =
Make sure you have unzipped the folder in the root of the */wp-content/plugins/* directory.

= How can I embed multiple forms on the same WordPress page? =
The most effective way is using the API key.

= If I change the form on 123FormBuilder after I pasted it in WordPress, shall I paste the code again? =
No, you don't have to paste the code again.

= If I update my WordPress to a newer version, will my forms work? =
Yes, your forms should be visible and working as before, as long as you have the latest version of 123FormBuilder plugin. Still, some users reported that after updating the WP version, their forms got broken. So, please check your forms and in case they're broken, all you have to do is to republish them.
